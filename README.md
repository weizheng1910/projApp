ProjApp

After working in Investment Operations for a year, I realised that it is difficult to stay on top of the tasks we have to do. Sometimes we can only work on a task after a team member has completed his or her part, and vice versa.

In Investment Banking Operations where there are multiple trade issues from different counterparties going on at any point in time, such instances of task interdependence are many, and noting them down on pen and paper is tedious and messy. 

A manager, or any team member for that matter, is also not able to stay up to date of the pressing issues going on, relying on weekly team meetings to keep everyone updated.

ProjApp is a task management app which aims to resolve this issue. It serves as a central platform where team members can notify the tasks they have for each other, categorised according to the trading counterparty. They can also highlight pertinent issues they have, or give notifications of the things others have to be mindful about when dealing with a particular counterparty.

All of these tasks and issues are condensed into a single page so that every team member (not only the manager) can instantly have a macro view updated of everything going on. Any team member will be able to easily step in and deal with a client, when the go-to person isn't around. Less meetings or phone calls will be necessary.  

To sum up, this app aims to address information failure, reducing key person risk within the team.
